# <r>I'm</r>-migration

<r>I'm</r>-migration is a web-based project designed and developed as part of our university coursework. This project showcases stories of people who have faced difficult journeys to build a new life in Europe. By sharing these experiences, the goal is to raise awareness about the difficulties encountered during the migration process and in adapting to a new reality in the destination country.

# Why "<r>I'm</r>-migration"?
"<r>I'm</r>-migration" encapsulates the main message: every immigrant's journey is deeply personal and unique. Five distinct stories of people who have left their lands due to wars, economic difficulties, social problems, and other reasons. Despite their different origins, they all share a common goal: <r>a better future</r>.
